Google provides appengine to create application. If somehow the developer or owner of the project missed the source code, it is very difficult to get it back. Right now, there is no way to get the LIVE source code of your application from appengine.

The people who are looking for a way to get rid of this, this project helps. But, if someone really care about the security of the source code, I would like to suggest not to use this.
